"""Enforcement of metrics's own feature switches in the API.

``@require_feature("key")`` rejects requests when a switch is OFF for the
requester. Backend enforcement is the source of truth — the frontend only
mirrors these switches (delivered via ``/auth/me`` and ``GET /api/features``).

Never gate: login, the RevenueCat webhook. The collect API is gated by
``collect-api`` as an emergency kill switch (503), never as a feature gate.
