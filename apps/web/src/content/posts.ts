          "metrics is the fourth app in the 3m4 family, after the URL shortener, the feature-flag service and the user-feedback inbox. It answers one question: who is visiting my apps, from where, on what? Each project gets a public key; drop one script tag in your site and page views start flowing into a dashboard with a time series, top pages, referrers, countries and cities, devices, browsers, operating systems, languages and UTM campaigns. No JavaScript possible (an email, a README)? Use the tracking pixel. Server-side? Post to the collect API.",
          "It is deliberately privacy-friendly: the tracker sets no cookie and stores nothing in the browser, the server hashes the IP address with a salt that rotates every day and keeps only the derived country, region and city, and raw user agents are discarded once device, browser and OS have been read. There is nothing to put in a cookie banner.",
          "The hosted version at metrics.3m4.net is in early access. During early access every account gets the full product: unlimited projects, unlimited events, full data retention, the management API and the MCP server. No card, no trial clock.",
