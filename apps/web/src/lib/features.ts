/**
 * metrics' OWN feature switches ("features"), mirrored from the backend (the
 * source of truth). Not to be confused with the events a project collects.
 *
 * Registry + fail-safe defaults live in `packages/shared/feature_flags.json`
 * (same pattern as plan_limits.json). Authenticated pages get resolved
 * features from `/auth/me`; anonymous pages (signup) from `GET /api/features`.
 * The UI only hides surfaces — enforcement happens in the Flask API.
