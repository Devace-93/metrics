/**
 * Tool-level authorization.
 *
 * Every tool declares the scope(s) it needs. The server consults this table
 * twice (defense in depth):
 *
 *   1. at registration — tools the key cannot use are never listed, so the
 *      model is not tempted to call them;
 *   2. at call time — a tool that is somehow invoked without its scope is
 *      refused and the refusal is audited.
 *
 * The REST API enforces the same scopes independently (layer 3), so a bug in
 * this file can never *grant* access, only hide it.
 *
 * The table mirrors the "MCP (AI agents)" section of CONTRACT.md.
