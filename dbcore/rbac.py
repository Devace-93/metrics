"""Role-based access control for API keys.

Source of truth: ``packages/shared/api_key_roles.json``. A *role* is a named
bundle of *scopes*; endpoints declare the scope they need with
``@require_scope("projects:write")`` and never reason about roles directly. That
keeps the policy data-driven: adding a role is a JSON edit, not a code change.

Dashboard users (JWT) are account owners and get every scope. API keys get the
scopes of the role chosen when the key was created.
