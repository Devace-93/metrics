"""Append-only audit trail for account-level actions.

Every mutating API call (and every authorization denial) writes one row to
``audit_events``: who (user or API key), what (``project.update`` ...), on which
target, and the outcome. Rows are never updated or deleted by application code.

Two entry points:

* :func:`record` — inside an existing transaction (the view's ``session_scope``),
  so the audit row commits atomically with the change it describes.
* :func:`record_standalone` — its own short transaction, for denials raised
  before any view transaction exists.
