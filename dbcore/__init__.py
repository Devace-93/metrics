"""dbcore — shared core used by the api service (and the migrate job).

Holds the single source of truth for: configuration, SQLAlchemy models,
plan limits, RBAC roles, key validation, hit normalisation and enrichment
(user agent, geo), IP hashing, usage metering, the audit trail and the PostHog
client. The API Docker image copies this package in next to ``packages/shared``.
